### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17-year-old living in New Delhi, India, and the new Head of the Computer Society at The Shri Ram School, Moulsari. 

I've been programming in some form or the other since I was in fifth grade. Over the years, I've worked with...
- Django, Flask, and FastAPI
- Flutter, UIKit, and SwiftUI
- ML and Data Science libraries like Keras, Turi Create, Pandas, OpenCV, and spAcy
- TailwindCSS, Bulma, and Bootstrap 
... and much more! 

I'm [currently learning Julia](https://github.com/ArjunS07/mit-computationalthinking)

I'm always open to research opportunities and collaborating on projects. You can reach me at (firstname).sharma07 at outlook dot com.
